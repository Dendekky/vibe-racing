# General Rules for Racing Game Project
- **Description**: Applies to all files in the project.
- **File Pattern**: **/* (all files)
- **Rule**: Write clean, modular code. Split logic into multiple files based on responsibility (e.g., networking in one file, physics in another). Avoid monolithic files with more than 300 lines of code. Use ES6 modules for imports/exports.
- **Rule**: Follow a consistent naming convention: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for React components and classes.
- **Rule**: Include JSDoc comments for all major functions and components to document purpose, parameters, and return values.
