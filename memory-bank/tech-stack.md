# Tech Stack: 3D Car Racing PvP Game

## Overview
This document outlines the technology stack for building a 3D car racing PvP game with real-time multiplayer, bot support, and 3D graphics. The stack is designed to meet the game’s requirements: Next.js integration, 8-player rooms with bots, 5 race terrains, 4-lap races, and features like nitro and health mechanics.

## Frontend
- **Next.js**:
  - **Purpose**: Handles the UI (lobby, game room creation), server-side rendering, and static site generation.
  - **Why**: Requested by the developer; provides a robust framework for web-based games with built-in API routes.
  - **Use Case**: Lobby system, terrain selection, and initial game setup.
- **Three.js**:
  - **Purpose**: Renders 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL.
  - **Why**: Lightweight and widely supported for 3D game development in JavaScript.
  - **Use Case**: Car models, terrain visualization, and minimap rendering.
- **React**:
  - **Purpose**: Manages UI state and component lifecycle.
  - **Why**: Integrated with Next.js; simplifies dynamic updates like health bars and lap counters.
  - **Use Case**: HUD elements, lobby state, and terrain selection UI.

## Backend
- **Node.js**:
  - **Purpose**: Runs the server-side logic and game server.
  - **Why**: JavaScript consistency across the stack; strong ecosystem for real-time apps.
  - **Use Case**: Game room management, bot logic, and physics sync.
- **Socket.IO**:
  - **Purpose**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and server.
  - **Why**: Ideal for multiplayer sync (e.g., car positions, race events) with low latency.
  - **Use Case**: Player movement updates, nitro pickup notifications, and bot coordination.
- **Express.js**:
  - **Purpose**: Lightweight web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests.
  - **Why**: Simplifies API route creation and integrates well with Next.js.
  - **Use Case**: Room creation endpoints, initial terrain selection.

## Game Logic & Physics
- **Custom Game Server (Node.js + Socket.IO)**:
  - **Purpose**: Dedicated server for managing game state and real-time logic.
  - **Why**: Separates game simulation from frontend, ensuring scalability and performance.
  - **Use Case**: Tracks lap progress, manages bot AI, and enforces health mechanics.
- **Cannon.js**:
  - **Purpose**: Physics engine for 3D collisions and car dynamics.
  - **Why**: Lightweight, integrates seamlessly with Three.js, and sufficient for car physics.
  - **Use Case**: Car collisions, terrain interaction, and crash mechanics.
  - **Alternative**: Ammo.js (if higher precision is needed later).

## Database
- **Redis**:
  - **Purpose**: Fast, in-memory storage for temporary game data.
  - **Why**: Low-latency access suits real-time needs; supports expiration for cleanup.
  - **Use Case**: Stores room states, player positions, and race progress (TTL: 1 hour post-race).
- **MongoDB** (Optional):
  - **Purpose**: Persistent storage for user data and game history.
  - **Why**: Flexible NoSQL database for future features like leaderboards or profiles.
  - **Use Case**: User accounts, race statistics (if implemented).

## Deployment
- **Vercel**:
  - **Purpose**: Hosts the Next.js frontend and API routes.
  - **Why**: Seamless deployment for Next.js apps with auto-scaling and domain management.
  - **Use Case**: Deploys the lobby UI and static assets.
- **AWS EC2 or DigitalOcean**:
  - **Purpose**: Hosts the custom game server (Node.js + Socket.IO).
  - **Why**: Real-time services require a persistent instance beyond Vercel’s serverless limits.
  - **Use Case**: Runs the multiplayer game server for all active races.
- **Cloudflare CDN**:
  - **Purpose**: Serves static assets with global caching.
  - **Why**: Reduces latency for 3D models, textures, and audio files.
  - **Use Case**: Delivers terrain assets and car models efficiently.

## Development Tools
- **Cursor**:
  - **Purpose**: IDE with AI-powered coding assistance.
  - **Why**: Enhances productivity with project-specific rules and context-aware suggestions.
  - **Use Case**: Enforces modularity and best practices via `.cursor/rules`.
- **ESLint + Prettier**:
  - **Purpose**: Maintains code quality and consistency.
  - **Why**: Ensures readable, error-free code across the team.
  - **Use Case**: Lints JavaScript and enforces formatting.

## Performance Considerations
- **Target FPS**: 60 FPS for smooth 3D rendering (optimized via Three.js).
- **Network Latency**: <100ms for Socket.IO updates.
- **Asset Load Time**: <5 seconds for terrains and models (via CDN).

## Why This Stack?
- **Next.js**: Meets the developer’s requirement and provides a solid frontend base.
- **Three.js + Cannon.js**: Efficiently handles 3D rendering and physics in the browser.
- **Socket.IO**: Ensures real-time multiplayer and bot sync.
- **Modularity**: Separates frontend, game server, and rendering for maintainability.
- **Scalability**: Redis and a dedicated server support multiple rooms and players.

## Future Scalability
- Add **Load Balancers** (e.g., AWS ELB) for multiple game server instances.
- Integrate **WebRTC** (if peer-to-peer becomes viable for reducing server load).
- Expand **MongoDB** usage for persistent features like leaderboards or car unlocks.
